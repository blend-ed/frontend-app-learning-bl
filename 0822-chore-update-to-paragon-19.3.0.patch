Subject: [PATCH 0822/1021] chore: update to paragon 19.3.0

No change on our end, this is just to get us as up-to-date as
possible.

This is the latest version of paragon we probably want to use as
long as we still claim to support IE11 via browserlist. We start
getting warnings about grid-auto-rows not being supported in IE11
beginning in paragon 19.4.0 with its new SelectableBox component.

To update our browerlist to drop IE11, we'll need to update our
node version. Which is in progress elsewhere. But for this series
of commits, I've gotten as far as I can / want to with paragon.
